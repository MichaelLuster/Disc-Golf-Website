# Disc-Golf-Website
A disc golf management system, currently in the works, that is being built for interactions between buyers and sellers to be able to have a central place to be able to list, buy, and see last sold items more easily. Current features include a sign in/sign up, shopping cart, and a shop all option.

# Introduction
The current problem is there is no central place for people to be able to sell or see all the discs that everyone is selling, and instead all of the companies have their own website to sell discs or individual people are listing the discs they currently own on websites such as, eBay or Meta Platforms( previously known as Facebook) marketplace. This has resulted in people having to go to numereous different places to hopefully find the right disc they are looking for or to find information about a disc they own.

# Goals
The goal is to be able create a more central place for people to be able to find a disc they are looking for and to have sellers on one central platform to attract more people to their products. 

# Current Progress <br> 
The current progress includes a main menu for people to be able to see the newest releases, as well as a sign in and sign up page

<br> The page also includes a way for buyers to be able to see all the discs from a certain company or a certain plastic, for now the page only contains a template for this.
